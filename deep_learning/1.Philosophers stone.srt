41
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:05,163

where Harry is delivered

42
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:10,001
{\an8}onto the Dursleys' front porch by Dumbledore,
and this is an interesting scene,

43
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:13,296
{\an8}because we actually had
to film the scene with a real baby

44
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,798
{\an8}and we found some triplets

45
00:04:15,882 --> 00:04:20,052
{\an8}who were able to work in 20-minute increments.

46
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:26,058
{\an8}And I just remember the one distinct thing
I remember about shooting this scene,

47
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:33,149
{\an8}is that the baby was such
a very jumpy, nervous sleeper,

48
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:38,196
{\an8}that we had to walk around
on our tiptoes and whisper,

49
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:41,365
{\an8}so you had a film crew of 150 people

50
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:43,576
{\an8}whispering throughout this entire scene.

51
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:46,746
{\an8}It's probably the most quiet scene
I've ever filmed.

52
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:52,627
{\an8}And then there was the problem
of actually applying Harry's scar,

53
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,963
{\an8}which was fresh at this point in the story.

54
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:58,049
{\an8}It just happened.

55
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:01,302
{\an8}Applying Harry's scar
onto the forehead of the baby

56
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:05,723
{\an8}was something that was impossible to do.
We just couldn't apply prosthetics to the baby.

57
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:09,602
{\an8}So the scar was actually digitally created.

58
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:12,730
{\an8}And I remember doing that close-up of the baby,

59
00:05:12,814 --> 00:05:14,899
we needed to just be extraordinarily quiet.

60
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:18,444
And it took us several takes because
the baby was always waking up and crying.

61
00:05:18,528 --> 00:05:22,156
It was actually one of the most calm nights
I've ever had on a film shoot,

62
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,784
because everyone was pleasant and whispering.

63
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:27,829
And we came up with this idea
when we were shooting the film

64
00:05:27,912 --> 00:05:32,124
{\an8}that it would be great to use the scar
as a transition between baby Harry

65
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:36,003

Daniel Radcliffe into the film.

to digital effects.

by adding all these digital owls.

that arrive through the fireplace

{\an8}Now, today, even six, seven, eight years later,

145
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:14,063

if they had something tangible to react to.

John Richardson,

00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:04,655
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?

162
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:41,859
Make a wish, Harry.

163
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:49,450
{\an8}Hagrid's arrival, to basically free Harry
and tell Harry, for the first time, he's a wizard,

164
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:51,577
this was quite a difficult scene to shoot,

165
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,413
because we actually had to build
two of these huts.

166
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:58,542
One of the huts was practical-sized
for all of the actors to work in,

167
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:02,463
with the exception of Robbie Coltrane,
who was playing the giant Hagrid.

168
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:06,633
{\an8}All of Robbie's material was shot
in a smaller hut,

169
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:10,095
{\an8}so when Robbie himself, dressed as Hagrid,
walked through the door,

170
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:12,890
{\an8}he appeared to be nine-feet tall.

171
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:19,438
And we shot all of the reverses
with the Dursleys and Harry

172
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,523
using a giant double

173
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:24,067
that we created for a former rugby player,

174
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:27,321
who has played Hagrid's double
in almost every film, I think.

175
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:29,615
{\an8}And we created this wonderful
prosthetic mask.

176
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:31,325
{\an8}So in long shots and wide shots,

177
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:35,746
{\an8}if you're interested in seeing exactly how
we put this together,

178
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:38,123
{\an8}you can actually see Harry walking,

179
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:41,418
{\an8}sometimes walking through the streets of London,
with this double.

180
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:43,462
{\an8}If you look close enough,
you can see the mask.

181
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:45,589
{\an8}We only used it very sparingly.

182
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:49,384
{\an8}When Hagrid walks through the door,
for instance,

183
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:53,305
{\an8}we actually shot all of Robbie's things
on the smaller set.

184
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:55,641
So this was an interesting moment
of directing for me,

185
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:58,852
because I actually had to get
a performance out of Daniel Radcliffe,

186
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:01,522
who should have been
emotionally moved at this point.

187
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:06,235
Yet at the same time, he couldn't connect
with the other actor in the room, Robbie Coltrane.

188
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:07,945
And that was a little difficult

189
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:11,573
{\an8}because he was reacting
to a guy basically in a Hagrid mask.

190
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:15,536
{\an8}So it was a complex puzzle piece
to put together.

191
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:18,747
{\an8}In the end, I thought it all worked out well.
It's just a wonderful moment.

192
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:22,292
{\an8}This is what happens when you work
with younger, inexperienced actors.

193
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:25,003
{\an8}It's a wonderful moment
with Daniel Radcliffe there,

194
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:28,006
{\an8}when he finds out
that he's a wizard for the first time.

195
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:32,928
{\an8}It's just, again, this sort of joy
on his face. It's just fantastic.

196
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:35,264
{\an8}It comes from the fact
that he had no acting lessons.

197
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:38,767
{\an8}He was really experiencing
that feeling in a real way.

198
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:43,897
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys
and Grounds at Hogwarts.

199
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:47,818
- Of course, you know about Hogwarts.
- Sorry, no.

200
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,823
Didn't you ever wonder where
your mum and dad learned it all?

201
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,033
Learned what?

202
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:57,077
{\an8}You're a wizard, Harry.

203
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:01,039
{\an8}- I'm a what?
- A wizard.

204
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:04,251
{\an8}A good one, I'd wager,
once you're trained up.

205
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:07,421
No, you've made a mistake.
I mean...

206
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:10,465
...I can't be a wizard.

207
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:15,929
I mean, I'm just Harry. Just Harry.

208
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:21,101
Well, Just Harry, did you ever
make anything happen?

209
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:24,688
Anything you couldn't explain,
when you were angry or scared?

210
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,151
Hm.

211
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:45,459
{\an8}HARRY: "Dear Mr. Potter,
We are pleased to accept you...

212
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:48,962
...at Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry."

213
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:54,134
He will not be going! We swore
we'd put a stop to all this rubbish.

214
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:58,597
You knew? You knew all along
and you never told me?

215
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,892
Of course we knew.
How could you not be?

216
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:05,812
My perfect sister being who she was.

217
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:11,860
My mother and father were so proud
the day she got her letter.

218
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:16,198
"We have a witch in the family.
Isn't it wonderful?"

219
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:19,993
I was the only one to see her
for what she was.

220
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:22,162
A freak!

221
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:25,374
Then she met that Potter,
and then she had you...

222
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:31,213
...and I knew you would be the same.
Just as strange, just as abnormal.

223
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:36,510
And then she got herself blown up,
and we got landed with you.

224
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:40,681
Blown up? You told me
my parents died in a car crash.

225
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:45,268
A car crash? A car crash killed
Lily and James Potter?

226
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:49,398
PETUNIA: We had to say something.
- It's an outrage! A scandal!

227
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:52,025
He'll not be going.

228
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:55,612
A great Muggle like you
is going to stop him?

229
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:56,697
Muggle?

230
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,951
Non-magic folk. This boy's had
his name down since he were born.

231
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:05,122
He's going to the finest school
of witchcraft and wizardry.

232
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:11,169
He'll be under the finest headmaster
Hogwarts has seen, Albus Dumbledore.

233
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:16,133
{\an8}I will not pay to have a crackpot
old fool teach him magic tricks.

234
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:20,887
{\an8}Never insult Albus Dumbledore...

235
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:23,140
...in front of me.

236
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:46,288
I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell
anyone at Hogwarts about that.

237
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:50,125
- I'm not allowed to do magic.
- Okay.

238
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:54,921
We're a bit behind schedule.
Best be off.

239
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:03,930
Unless you'd rather stay, of course.

240
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:22,449
"First-year students will require
three sets of plain work robes,

241
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:24,493
one wand..."

242
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:26,620
Essential bit of equipment, Harry.

243
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,290
"One pair of dragonhide gloves."

244
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,834
Hagrid, do they mean from a real dragon?

245
00:21:32,918 --> 00:21:35,295
Well, they don't mean a penguin, do they?

246
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:41,468
- Blimey, I'd love a dragon.
- You'd like a dragon?

247
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:44,262
Vastly misunderstood beasts, Harry.

248
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:46,640
Vastly misunderstood.

249
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:56,775
{\an8}HARRY:
"All students must be equipped with...

250
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:59,778
{\an8}...one standard size 2
pewter cauldron...

251
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:04,825
{\an8}...and may bring, if they desire,
either an owl, a cat or a toad."

252
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,536
{\an8}Can we find all this in London?

253
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:10,163
{\an8}If you know where to go.

254
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:37,023
Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?

255
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:40,527
No, thanks, Tom.
I'm on official Hogwarts business.

256
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:44,489
Just helping Harry buy
his school supplies.

257
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:47,534
Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter!

258
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:55,417
Welcome back, Mr. Potter.
Welcome back.

259
00:22:56,084 --> 00:23:00,297
{\an8}Doris Crockford. I can't believe
I'm meeting you at last.

260
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:06,177
{\an8}Harry Potter. Can't tell you
how pleased I am to meet you.

261
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:08,847
{\an8}Hello, professor. I didn't see you.

262
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:13,977
{\an8}Professor Quirrell will be your
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

263
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:16,563
Oh, nice to meet you.

264
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:19,941
Fearfully fascinating subject.

265
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:24,738
Not that you need it, eh, Potter?

266
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:29,868
Yes, well, must be going now.
Lots to buy.

267
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:31,828
HARRY:
Goodbye.

268
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:38,126
- See, Harry? You're famous.
- But why am I famous?

269
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:41,880
All those people,
how is it they know who I am?

270
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:45,800
I'm not sure I'm the right person
to tell you that.

271
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:51,848
{\an8}Here we have the Diagon Alley sequence,
which is one of my favorite sequences in the film.

272
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:57,020
{\an8}It's fantastic because we actually created
this entire Diagon Alley set

273
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:58,647
{\an8}on a soundstage in Leavesden.

274
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,608
{\an8}Although, calling it a soundstage
is really not appropriate

275
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:04,402
{\an8}since there were leaks,
we would always hear rain coming through,

276
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:06,363
{\an8}we could always hear planes
flying overhead,

277
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:09,908
{\an8}but it worked for us in terms
of the amount of space to build the set.

278
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:14,079
{\an8}But this Diagon Alley set
was really a wonderful thing,

279
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:18,208
{\an8}when we'd bring visitors to the set,
because it was part of our Harry Potter World,

280
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:21,670
{\an8}you know, when we brought school kids to visit.

281
00:24:21,753 --> 00:24:24,255
{\an8}You could actually walk
down these cobblestone streets.

282
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:28,802
{\an8}I really wanted Diagon Alley to have
this sort of warped, Dickensian feel,

283
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:31,304
{\an8}and to feel as if it had existed
for hundreds of years.

284
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:34,891
{\an8}So, this is really a major achievement

285
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:39,354
{\an8}from our production designer, Stuart Craig,
who I think did a brilliant job

286
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:43,024
{\an8}in his attention to detail in terms
of all these wizard shops

287
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:44,275
{\an8}that exist on Diagon Alley.

288
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:46,903
{\an8}It had to feel like a place
you had never been to before.

289
00:24:46,987 --> 00:24:50,198
{\an8}And we see it through Harry's eyes
which was my feeling about the whole film.

290
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:52,575
It just had to happen
through Harry's point of view.

291
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:56,705
BOY 1:
It's a world-class racing broom.

292
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:01,459
In this particular moment, there's my son,
my son who is much older now,

293
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:04,379
looking at the Nimbus 2000 in the window.

294
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:07,799
{\an8}So, it's sort of like having
very expensive home movies for me to look at.

295
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:12,679
But how am I to pay for all this?
I haven't any money.

296
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:16,224
{\an8}There's your money.
Gringotts, the wizard bank.

297
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:21,104
{\an8}Ain't no safer place, not one.
Except perhaps Hogwarts.

298
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:38,747
{\an8}Hagrid, what exactly are these things?

299
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:44,085
{\an8}They're goblins. Clever as they come,
but not the most friendly of beasts.

300
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:46,337
{\an8}Best stay close.

301
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:48,923
[HAGRID CLEARS THROAT]

302
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:53,928
Mr. Harry Potter wishes
to make a withdrawal.

303
00:25:58,183 --> 00:26:01,352
And does Mr. Harry Potter
have his key?

304
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,522
Wait a minute.
Got it here somewhere.

305
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:11,196
Ha! There's the little devil.

306
00:26:11,446 --> 00:26:14,282
And there's something else as well.

307
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,952
Professor Dumbledore gave me this.

308
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:28,088
It's about you-know-what
in vault you-know-which.

309
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:31,007
Very well.

310
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:38,807
Vault 687.

311
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:43,228
Lamp, please.

312
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:53,321
Key, please.

313
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:19,889
Did you think your parents
would leave you with nothing?

314
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:25,687
{\an8}GOBLIN: Vault 713.
HARRY: What's in there, Hagrid?

315
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:30,066
{\an8}HAGRID: Can't tell you.
Hogwarts business. Very secret.

316
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,734
GOBLIN:
Stand back.

317
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:02,807
Best not to mention this to anyone.

318
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:15,153
{\an8}I still need a wand.

319
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:18,907
You want Ollivanders.
There ain't no place better.

320
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:24,579
Run along there and wait.
I got one more thing to do.

321
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:32,170
{\an8}Here we have a scene that was
a real joy to shoot, Ollivanders Wand Shop.

322
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:34,339
{\an8}And the great thing
about this particular scene,

323
00:28:34,422 --> 00:28:36,633
{\an8}it's the first time and the only time

324
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:39,594
{\an8}that JK Rowling showed up
at the set to visit.

325
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:42,764
{\an8}It was her only day there,
so I was a little nervous.

326
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:45,350
{\an8}I walked her through Diagon Alley,
and she loved it.

327
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:50,897
{\an8}She loved-- again, the attention to detail
that our production designer, Stuart Craig,

328
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,523
{\an8}paid to every single shop.

329
00:28:52,607 --> 00:28:55,276
{\an8}Even if we weren't going inside
these particular shops,

330
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,864
{\an8}there was an attention to detail to the shelves,
to the things that existed on the shelves.

331
00:28:59,948 --> 00:29:02,951
All of these boxes were individually made,

332
00:29:03,034 --> 00:29:06,955
hand-printed, stamped,
with the Ollivander Wand Shop logo.

333
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:08,122
It was just unbelievable.

334
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:12,710
...that your mother and father were
in here buying their first wands.

335
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:22,095
Here we are.

336
00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:32,522
Give it a wave.

337
00:29:39,654 --> 00:29:41,239
Apparently not.

338
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:50,999
{\an8}Another great thing about the Harry Potter films
is you get an opportunity to work with actors

339
00:29:51,082 --> 00:29:54,544
{\an8}who would never consider
coming in to do one or two days' work.

340
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:56,087
{\an8}In this particular situation,

341
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,797
{\an8}John Hurt, who was a fan of the books,

342
00:29:57,922 --> 00:30:00,466
{\an8}agreed to play Ollivander
for just a couple of days.

343
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,051
{\an8}You don't see that in films a lot.

344
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:05,555
{\an8}And so, it was wonderful
getting a chance to work

345
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:07,515
{\an8}with one of my favorite British actors.

346
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:10,977
{\an8}And also, again, in this Potter film,
this early Potter film,

347
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:14,856
one of the things I love about it is
its sort of old-fashioned charm.

348
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:17,525
A lot of these visual effects
in this particular sequence

349
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:19,402
were, again, done practically.

350
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:21,404
We didn't just resort to saying,

351
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:25,992
"Okay, let's do them by digital effects.
Let's use CGI." We didn't do it here.

352
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:27,702
{\an8}When Harry first gets the wand,

353
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:32,707
{\an8}we wanted to create this magical moment
and feeling of power with the wand.

354
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:35,835
{\an8}Well, that was created
by slowing the frame rate.

355
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:37,712
{\an8}Film usually runs at 24 frames per second.

356
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:40,673
{\an8}And we slowed the frame rate down
to 120 frames per second,

357
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:44,385
{\an8}created a sense of smoke,
blew some wind through Harry's hair.

358
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:46,262
{\an8}And thought, "If this works, we'll use it.

359
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:48,723
{\an8}If not, we may need to enhance it
with digital effects."

360
00:30:48,806 --> 00:30:53,102
{\an8}It worked beautifully.
It created a sense of you being there.

361
00:30:53,186 --> 00:30:56,731
{\an8}And I love creating tangible effects in films,

362
00:30:56,814 --> 00:31:01,027
{\an8}because it really harkens back
to the old days of filmmaking.

363
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,112
{\an8}And for me, this scene is...

364
00:31:03,196 --> 00:31:05,823
{\an8}We could have filled it with visual effects.

365
00:31:05,907 --> 00:31:08,493
{\an8}But it's all about the performances
of the two actors.

366
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:10,661
Just one other.

367
00:31:10,745 --> 00:31:15,249
It is curious that you should
be destined for this wand...

368
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:20,546
...when its brother gave you that scar.

369
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:25,635
And who owned that wand?

370
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:29,472
We do not speak his name.

371
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:33,434
The wand chooses
the wizard, Mr. Potter.

372
00:31:33,518 --> 00:31:36,562
It's not always clear why.

373
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:40,525
But I think it is clear...

374
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:43,653
...that we can expect
great things from you.

375
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:49,242
After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...

376
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:52,036
...did great things.

377
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,621
Terrible...

378
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,000
...yes, but great.

379
00:32:02,213 --> 00:32:03,381
{\an8}[KNOCKING]

380
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:05,508
{\an8}HAGRID:
Harry! Harry!

381
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:07,802
{\an8}Happy birthday.

382
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:10,930
{\an8}HARRY:
Wow.

383
00:32:15,393 --> 00:32:18,896
You all right, Harry?
You seem very quiet.

384
00:32:19,272 --> 00:32:24,819
He killed my parents, didn't he?
The one who gave me this.

385
00:32:25,069 --> 00:32:28,781
You know, Hagrid. I know you do.

386
00:32:32,577 --> 00:32:36,164
First, and understand this
because it's very important:

387
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:39,834
Not all wizards are good.

388
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:42,753
Some of them go bad.
A few years ago...

389
00:32:42,879 --> 00:32:47,800
...there was a wizard who went as bad
as you can go. His name was V--

390
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:51,804
- His name was V--
- Maybe if you wrote it down?

391
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:53,681
No, I can't spell it.

392
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:58,352
{\an8}- All right, Voldemort.
- V o I d e m o rt?

393
00:32:58,436 --> 00:33:00,813
{\an8}Shh.

394
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:04,358
It was dark times, Harry.

395
00:33:06,694 --> 00:33:09,822
<i>Voldemort started
to gather some followers.</i>

396
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:12,992
<i>Brought them over to the Dark Side.</i>

397
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:17,872
{\an8}<i>Anyone that stood up to him
ended up dead.</i>

398
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,375
{\an8}<i>Your parents fought against him.</i>

399
00:33:22,293 --> 00:33:25,755
{\an8}<i>But nobody lived once
he decided to kill them.</i>

400
00:33:30,468 --> 00:33:33,054
<i>Nobody, not one.</i>

401
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:35,473
<i>Except you.</i>

402
00:33:37,642 --> 00:33:41,729
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?

403
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:46,400
Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut
on your forehead, Harry.

404
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:52,406
A mark like that only comes from being
touched by a curse, an evil curse.

405
00:33:52,657 --> 00:33:56,244
What happened to V--?
To You-Know-Who?

406
00:33:57,411 --> 00:34:00,748
Well, some say he died.

407
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:03,417
Codswallop, in my opinion.

408
00:34:03,626 --> 00:34:06,879
Nope, I reckon he's out there still...

409
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:10,049
...too tired to carry on.

410
00:34:10,258 --> 00:34:15,137
But one thing's certain. Something
about you stumped him that night.

411
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:20,184
That's why you're famous.
That's why everybody knows your name.

412
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:23,187
{\an8}You're the boy who lived.

413
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:35,825
{\an8}What are you looking at?

414
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:40,121
{\an8}Blimey, is that the time?

415
00:34:40,204 --> 00:34:44,458
{\an8}I'm gonna have to leave you.
Dumbledore will be wanting his--

416
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:49,589
{\an8}Well, he'll be wanting to see me.
Your train leaves in 10 minutes.

417
00:34:49,672 --> 00:34:53,593
Here's your ticket. Stick to your ticket,
that's very important.

418
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:00,099
{\an8}"Platform 9 3/4"?

419
00:35:00,308 --> 00:35:05,229
{\an8}But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake.
This says platform 9 3/4.

420
00:35:05,313 --> 00:35:07,648
{\an8}There's no such thing, is there?

421
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:19,285
{\an8}Here we have Platform 9 3/4.

422
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:24,040
{\an8}Interesting scene, because we were
sort of forced into shooting this

423
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:26,459
{\an8}at King's Cross Station on a Sunday,

424
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:31,130
{\an8}obviously the least-busiest day
of the week for a train station.

425
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:33,341
{\an8}So we all got there early on a Sunday morning,

426
00:35:33,424 --> 00:35:38,929
{\an8}and this particular sequence,
my assistant and my driver and my daughter--

427
00:35:39,013 --> 00:35:41,766
{\an8}That is my fellow, Harry,

428
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:44,602
{\an8}who drove me throughout
the first three Potter films,

429
00:35:44,685 --> 00:35:47,271
{\an8}so we became very good friends
and I put him in my film,

430
00:35:47,355 --> 00:35:49,523
{\an8}in this Harry Potter film,

431
00:35:49,607 --> 00:35:53,861
{\an8}and he has since been--
He was put in the second Harry Potter film,

432
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:57,531
{\an8}and then Tim Burton fell in love with Harry
and now Harry's in every Tim Burton movie.

433
00:35:57,615 --> 00:36:01,410
{\an8}So he's still driving,
but he gets a cameo in every British film.

434
00:36:01,494 --> 00:36:03,829
{\an8}This presented quite a problem for us

435
00:36:03,913 --> 00:36:09,168
{\an8}because, again,
my desire to do visual effects here practically,

436
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:10,878
{\an8}obviously are not going to work

437
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:13,881
{\an8}when someone has to pass through
an existing brick wall.

438
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:19,345
{\an8}So we decided to actually do this
with digital effects.

439
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:20,805
{\an8}And it works very well.

440
00:36:20,888 --> 00:36:24,684
{\an8}It's a very, sort of, early, crude version
of someone disappearing into the wall

441
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:27,311
but it was sort of the best
we could do at the time.

442
00:36:27,478 --> 00:36:28,771
Excuse me.

443
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:33,067
Interestingly enough, I love seeing
the Weasleys for the first time here.

444
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:37,822
The Weasleys are one of my favorite families
and groups of characters from the first books,

445
00:36:37,905 --> 00:36:41,158
because they were poor,
they were always wearing hand-me-down clothes.

446
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:42,910
{\an8}They were all red-headed.

447
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:45,329
{\an8}I have a red-headed wife
and four red-headed children.

448
00:36:45,413 --> 00:36:48,541
{\an8}So I'm partial to redheads anyway.

449
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:51,711
{\an8}And this is the first time that
Harry and Ginny Weasley meet,

450
00:36:51,794 --> 00:36:54,463
{\an8}and if you've read the books,
you know what happens to them.

451
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:58,467
{\an8}So I think that's a very sweet,
nostalgic moment there.

452
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:52,146
Excuse me. Do you mind?
Everywhere else is full.

453
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:53,481
Not at all.

454
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:57,943
{\an8}Again, if you're a fan of the books
or the films, a historical moment.

455
00:37:58,027 --> 00:38:01,238
{\an8}First time that the three kids
actually meet.

456
00:38:01,322 --> 00:38:04,408
{\an8}First time that Rupert and Dan
see each other and meet,

457
00:38:04,492 --> 00:38:07,578
{\an8}and the first time, I think,
Rupert says the word, "Wicked."

458
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:09,872
{\an8}Which was part of his personality.

459
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:11,624
{\an8}It was something he always said.

460
00:38:11,707 --> 00:38:13,709
{\an8}And I think still says to this day.

461
00:38:15,795 --> 00:38:17,505
Wicked!

462
00:38:18,756 --> 00:38:22,134
The look of the interior of the train
was inspired by <i>A Hard Day's Night,</i>

463
00:38:22,218 --> 00:38:24,512
{\an8}Beatles film from 1964, Richard Lester.

464
00:38:24,595 --> 00:38:27,181
{\an8}I wanted the feeling of the inside of the train

465
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:31,519
{\an8}to feel exactly like the train
that John, Paul, George and Ringo

466
00:38:31,602 --> 00:38:34,355
{\an8}were riding in in the first 20 minutes
of <i>A Hard Day's Night,</i>

467
00:38:34,438 --> 00:38:36,649
so Stuart Craig recreated
the look of that train.

468
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:38,776
Unfortunately, we couldn't shoot
on a real train,

469
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:42,071
so we utilized some helicopter shots
that you see here.

470
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:45,115
And then we shot in front
of a green screen.

471
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:48,118
{\an8}And were able to shoot
with the kids on a stage,

472
00:38:48,202 --> 00:38:50,996
{\an8}as I worked very, very hard

473
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,458
{\an8}to get their performances to a point
that I could cut them together in the film,

474
00:38:54,542 --> 00:38:57,628
{\an8}because they were kids,
they had not acted before.

475
00:38:57,711 --> 00:38:59,797
This was one of the first times
they'd done a film.

476
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,883
And particularly Rupert,
he was truly falling in love

477
00:39:02,967 --> 00:39:05,219
with all of the candy
he was able to eat on screen.

478
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:08,013
He thought this was the greatest day
of his acting career,

479
00:39:08,097 --> 00:39:10,266
because we were just letting him eat
all this candy.

480
00:39:10,516 --> 00:39:13,978
{\an8}Each pack's got a famous witch
or wizard. I've got about 500 meself.

481
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:18,649
{\an8}Watch it!

482
00:39:21,277 --> 00:39:25,072
{\an8}That's rotten luck. They've only
got one good jump in them.

483
00:39:27,867 --> 00:39:31,370
{\an8}- I've got Dumbledore!
- I got about six of him.

484
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:35,249
Hey, he's gone!

485
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:38,878
You can't expect him to
hang around all day, can you?

486
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:42,673
This is Scabbers. Pathetic, isn't he?

487
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:44,049
A little.

488
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:47,636
Fred gave me a spell
to turn him yellow. Want to see?

489
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,804
Yeah.

490
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:55,102
{\an8}And when Hermione arrives,

491
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:57,479
{\an8}it was the first time we saw Emma.

492
00:39:57,563 --> 00:40:01,233
{\an8}And we really--
Her look has changed considerably.

493
00:40:01,317 --> 00:40:05,112
{\an8}We were so concerned
about being faithful to the look

494
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:09,074
{\an8}of what Jo Rowling had created.

495
00:40:09,158 --> 00:40:12,828
And Hermione was written as someone
who had this incredibly bushy hair.

496
00:40:12,912 --> 00:40:15,247
So we gave Emma this hairstyle
that I think,

497
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:18,751
along with each film, started to get
more and more glamorized, a little bit.

498
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:22,630
{\an8}But anyway, I love this scene
because we really get a sense

499
00:40:22,713 --> 00:40:26,133
{\an8}of what happens throughout
the next seven movies,

500
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:32,014
{\an8}because these kids, their personality
is defined in this particular scene.

501
00:40:32,973 --> 00:40:34,850
For example:

502
00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:37,603
<i>Oculus Reparo.</i>

503
00:40:40,397 --> 00:40:42,399
{\an8}That's better, isn't it?

504
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:48,280
{\an8}Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!

505
00:40:48,364 --> 00:40:52,034
{\an8}I'm Hermione Granger.
And you are...?

506
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,996
{\an8}- I'm Ron Weasley.
- Pleasure.

507
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:00,250
You two better change into robes.
I expect we'll be arriving soon.

508
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:08,842
You've got dirt on your nose.
Did you know?

509
00:41:08,926 --> 00:41:10,552
Just there.

510
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:27,069
Right, then.
First years, this way, please!

511
00:41:27,444 --> 00:41:29,238
Come on, first years, don't be shy.

512
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:32,449
{\an8}Come on now, hurry up.

513
00:41:39,456 --> 00:41:42,459
{\an8}- Hello, Harry.
- Hi, Hagrid.

514
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:43,711
{\an8}Whoa.

515
00:41:43,794 --> 00:41:47,381
{\an8}Right, then. This way to the boats.
Come on now, follow me.

516
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,120
Wow.

517
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:24,626
{\an8}In this particular shot,

518
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:29,757
{\an8}Hogwarts is all digital.
Everything about it is a digitized version

519
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,384
{\an8}of what we eventually built as a model.

520
00:42:32,468 --> 00:42:34,595
{\an8}And the model of Hogwarts that we built

521
00:42:34,678 --> 00:42:36,930
{\an8}was on an enormous stage

522
00:42:37,014 --> 00:42:40,893
{\an8}and it was probably 20-feet high

523
00:42:40,976 --> 00:42:43,062
{\an8}and about 50-feet wide.

524
00:42:43,145 --> 00:42:44,938
{\an8}And it was built on a model of a mountain.

525
00:42:45,022 --> 00:42:48,901
{\an8}And the attention to detail
to that Hogwarts model was stunning.

526
00:42:48,984 --> 00:42:51,904
{\an8}I'm sure it still exists
at the Leavesden soundstages.

527
00:42:51,987 --> 00:42:55,365
{\an8}And so we were really careful
about making absolutely certain

528
00:42:55,449 --> 00:42:58,744
{\an8}that the first time we saw Hogwarts,
it was extremely magical.

529
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,793
Welcome to Hogwarts.

530
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:10,130
Shortly, you'll pass through
these doors and join your classmates.

531
00:43:10,214 --> 00:43:15,385
But before you take your seats,
you must be sorted into your houses.

532
00:43:15,469 --> 00:43:18,722
They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff...

533
00:43:18,806 --> 00:43:22,768
...Ravenclaw and Slytherin.

534
00:43:23,811 --> 00:43:28,816
{\an8}While you're here, your house
will be like your family.

535
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:32,861
{\an8}Your triumphs will earn you points.

536
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:36,573
{\an8}Any rule-breaking
and you will lose points.

537
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:42,830
{\an8}At the end of the year, the house with
the most points wins the house cup.

538
00:43:42,913 --> 00:43:44,289
Trevor!

539
00:43:53,173 --> 00:43:54,800
Sorry.

540
00:43:55,008 --> 00:43:58,345
The Sorting Ceremony
will begin momentarily.

541
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:03,684
It's true then,
what they're saying on the train.

542
00:44:04,143 --> 00:44:06,728
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.

543
00:44:06,812 --> 00:44:08,313
Harry Potter?

544
00:44:08,939 --> 00:44:11,733
This is Crabbe and Goyle.

545
00:44:11,817 --> 00:44:14,236
And I'm Malfoy.

546
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,863
Draco Malfoy.

547
00:44:18,782 --> 00:44:22,452
Think my name's funny, do you?
I've no need to ask yours.

548
00:44:22,536 --> 00:44:27,624
Red hair and a hand-me-down robe?
You must be a Weasley.

549
00:44:29,251 --> 00:44:33,380
{\an8}You'll find out some wizarding families
are better than others.

550
00:44:33,463 --> 00:44:36,758
{\an8}You don't want to go making friends
with the wrong sort.

551
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:39,011
{\an8}I can help you there.

552
00:44:41,889 --> 00:44:44,683
{\an8}I think I can tell the wrong sort
for myself, thanks.

553
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:53,609
We're ready for you now.
Follow me.

554
00:44:53,942 --> 00:44:57,529
{\an8}Another really wonderful day of shooting.

555
00:44:57,613 --> 00:45:01,491
{\an8}This, I remember, was the first time
we see the Great Hall.

556
00:45:01,575 --> 00:45:05,370
{\an8}And the Great Hall continues, to this day,

557
00:45:05,454 --> 00:45:07,706
{\an8}to exist at Leavesden studios in London.

558
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:10,000
{\an8}And we built the entire Great Hall,

559
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:11,960
{\an8}and even those candles that you see,

560
00:45:12,044 --> 00:45:15,422
{\an8}some of those candles are supplemented
by digital candles.

561
00:45:15,505 --> 00:45:18,926
{\an8}That particular shot of the sky
with the candles floating is a digital shot,

562
00:45:19,009 --> 00:45:22,054
{\an8}but most of those candles
were actually lit candles

563
00:45:22,137 --> 00:45:25,224
{\an8}hanging on strings
on a complicated pulley system

564
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:27,309
{\an8}that lifted them up and down.

565
00:45:28,101 --> 00:45:31,063
{\an8}And when we first saw that shot in dailies,

566
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:35,692
everyone applauded
because they had never seen anything like it.

567
00:45:35,776 --> 00:45:38,487
And we created it all in-camera,

568
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,239
so we felt really good about that.

569
00:45:41,323 --> 00:45:43,742
{\an8}Again, it had that practical feeling.

570
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:46,245
{\an8}It didn't have that artificial quality
of visual effects,

571
00:45:46,328 --> 00:45:49,539
{\an8}and you actually felt as if this place
really existed.

572
00:45:49,623 --> 00:45:51,208
{\an8}It really brought you into the world.

573
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:54,044
{\an8}I learned all of that
from watching those old pictures,

574
00:45:54,127 --> 00:45:56,296
{\an8}like <i>Beauty and the Beast,</i>

575
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:59,007
{\an8}and really seeing what Jean Cocteau
did at the time

576
00:45:59,091 --> 00:46:03,887
{\an8}by creating this magic
out of these tangible things and sets.

577
00:46:03,971 --> 00:46:06,640
{\an8}It's the first time we see Filch and his cat.

578
00:46:06,723 --> 00:46:10,352
We digitally altered those cat's eyes
so they would be red, as in the books.

579
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:13,689
And this is the first introduction
of Richard Harris as Dumbledore,

580
00:46:13,772 --> 00:46:16,358
who actually delivers his first speech
in this scene.

581
00:46:17,651 --> 00:46:21,863
When I call your name,
you will come forth.

582
00:46:21,947 --> 00:46:25,575
{\an8}I shall place the Sorting Hat
on your head...

583
00:46:25,659 --> 00:46:28,161
{\an8}...and you will be sorted
into your houses.

584
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:31,123
Hermione Granger.

585
00:46:34,084 --> 00:46:36,753
{\an8}Oh, no. Okay, relax.

586
00:46:37,129 --> 00:46:40,549
{\an8}Mental, that one, I'm telling you.

587
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:49,808
{\an8}Ah, right, then. Mm, right.

588
00:46:49,933 --> 00:46:53,687
Okay. Gryffindor!

589
00:47:02,404 --> 00:47:04,114
Draco Malfoy.

590
00:47:09,745 --> 00:47:11,496
Slytherin!

591
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:15,834
Every wizard who went bad
was in Slytherin.

592
00:47:16,043 --> 00:47:18,128
Susan Bones.

593
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:27,095
{\an8}Ah!

594
00:47:27,179 --> 00:47:28,680
{\an8}Harry, what is it?

595
00:47:29,473 --> 00:47:32,351
{\an8}Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.

596
00:47:32,434 --> 00:47:34,019
{\an8}SORTING HAT:
Let's see...

597
00:47:34,144 --> 00:47:35,729
{\an8}I know!

598
00:47:35,812 --> 00:47:37,356
Here is the Sorting Hat sequence.

599
00:47:37,439 --> 00:47:41,526
{\an8}That young lady being sorted is my daughter
Eleanor, who played Susan Bones in the films.

600
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:44,529
{\an8}And for a kid who's 11 years old
and who got me into the books,

601
00:47:44,613 --> 00:47:48,617
{\an8}the ability to come to the Harry Potter set every day

602
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,911
{\an8}was really a wonderful thing for her childhood.

603
00:47:50,994 --> 00:47:54,164
{\an8}And here we have Ron Weasley being sorted
with the Sorting Hat.

604
00:47:54,247 --> 00:47:56,708
{\an8}And we created a digital Sorting Hat.

605
00:47:56,792 --> 00:47:59,795
{\an8}There was no way, obviously,
to do this practically.

606
00:48:00,629 --> 00:48:03,340
{\an8}In shots where the Sorting Hat
is not speaking,

607
00:48:03,423 --> 00:48:04,800
{\an8}it is a real Sorting Hat.

608
00:48:04,883 --> 00:48:08,136
{\an8}We had about three or four of them.
I still have one back in my office.

609
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,680
{\an8}But this Sorting Hat,
the one that Harry wears,

610
00:48:10,764 --> 00:48:13,183
{\an8}and the one that Ron wears
in the sequence,

611
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:15,644
{\an8}was just a brim with all of these wires

612
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:18,355
{\an8}and green little balls and things
on top of it.

613
00:48:18,438 --> 00:48:23,944
{\an8}So that particular Sorting Hat
was created in a digital environment.

614
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:30,325
{\an8}And I wanted the audience to actually get a chance
to see the Sorting Hat as he's sorting Harry.

615
00:48:30,409 --> 00:48:33,995
So we came up
with this wonderful 360-degree angle shot,

616
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:38,875
where we could pan around Harry's expression
as he's listening to the Sorting Hat.

617
00:48:40,085 --> 00:48:42,129
I find that when you do this on screen

618
00:48:42,212 --> 00:48:44,464
as opposed to just sitting there
and holding a shot,

619
00:48:44,548 --> 00:48:47,968
when you actually pan around
a digital effect

620
00:48:48,051 --> 00:48:49,719
and see it moving,

621
00:48:49,803 --> 00:48:52,889
it creates a better sense of reality
for the audience.

622
00:48:53,557 --> 00:48:55,434
So that's really what we did here.

623
00:48:55,517 --> 00:48:59,312
And the Sorting Hat has
this extremely wonderful personality

624
00:48:59,396 --> 00:49:00,981
that I was very pleased with.

625
00:49:01,064 --> 00:49:04,818
It reminded me of the illustration
from the first Harry Potter book I had seen.

626
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:06,736
The Sorting Hat looked very much like this,

627
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:09,364
so I was very proud of this visual effect.

628
00:49:09,448 --> 00:49:11,324
{\an8}And when Harry finds out he's in Gryffindor,

629
00:49:11,408 --> 00:49:13,618
{\an8}I just think it's a wonderful moment
again for Harry.

630
00:49:13,702 --> 00:49:14,911
{\an8}Again, this sense of joy

631
00:49:14,995 --> 00:49:18,457
{\an8}from this kid who's led 11 years
of this horrific life with the Dursleys.

632
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:21,293
{\an8}It's just such a wonderful sense of belonging.

633
00:49:21,376 --> 00:49:24,796
{\an8}He's really finding his family for the first time.

634
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,633
{\an8}And I just find it wonderfully touching.

635
00:49:39,603 --> 00:49:41,980
Your attention, please.

636
00:49:44,524 --> 00:49:47,152
Let the feast begin.

637
00:49:52,157 --> 00:49:54,284
{\an8}Wow.

638

when he found out.

{\an8}Percy, who's that teacher
talking to Professor Quirrell?

642
00:50:17,766 --> 00:50:21,186
{\an8}PERCY: Professor Snape,
head of Slytherin house.

643
00:50:21,269 --> 00:50:23,271
{\an8}- What's he teach?
- Potions.

644
00:50:23,355 --> 00:50:28,235
But he fancies the Dark Arts.
He's been after Quirrell's job for years.

Hello, Sir Nicholas.
Have a nice summer?

649
00:50:59,683 --> 00:51:05,105
Dismal. Once again, my request to join
the Headless Hunt has been denied.

650
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:11,152
I know you.
You're Nearly Headless Nick.

651
00:51:11,278 --> 00:51:14,114
I prefer Sir Nicholas,
if you don't mind.

652
00:51:14,197 --> 00:51:17,826
"Nearly" headless?
How can you be nearly headless?

653
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:19,202
Like this.

654
00:51:19,494 --> 00:51:22,998
{\an8}Here's Nearly Headless Nick,
which was a sequence

655
00:51:23,081 --> 00:51:26,167
{\an8}everyone was worried we were going to end up
getting a PG-13

656
00:51:26,251 --> 00:51:29,629
{\an8}because Nick removes his head
in the sequence.

657
00:51:29,713 --> 00:51:31,506
{\an8}Working with John Cleese again,

658
00:51:31,631 --> 00:51:34,884
{\an8}having been a fan of <i>Monty Python's Flying Circus</i>
and <i>Fawlty Towers,</i>

659
00:51:34,968 --> 00:51:37,429
{\an8}it was just a wonderful opportunity
for me to get a chance

660
00:51:37,512 --> 00:51:39,139
{\an8}to work with one of my comedic heroes.

661
00:51:39,222 --> 00:51:41,308
{\an8}This is the first time
we see the moving staircase

662
00:51:41,391 --> 00:51:46,021
{\an8}which, to me, is really, again,
a marvel of a combination

663
00:51:46,104 --> 00:51:48,273
{\an8}of building something practically

664
00:51:48,356 --> 00:51:50,108
{\an8}and also creating a CG world.

665
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:52,652
{\an8}When we first look up
and see all of the moving staircases,

666
00:51:52,736 --> 00:51:54,613
{\an8}obviously we could have never built that,

667
00:51:54,696 --> 00:51:57,282
{\an8}but we were able to create it digitally.

668
00:51:57,365 --> 00:52:00,910
{\an8}And it created this wonderful sense
of real magic,

669
00:52:00,994 --> 00:52:03,413
{\an8}but when the staircase moves
in other moments in the film,

670
00:52:03,496 --> 00:52:05,206
{\an8}and the kids are on the staircase,

671
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:08,835
{\an8}we built a mechanical staircase
that moves from wall to wall.

McGonagall's face if we were late?

685
00:54:23,052 --> 00:54:28,016
- That was bloody brilliant!
- Thank you for that assessment.

686

{\an8}It'd be better if I transfigured
Mr. Potter and you into a watch.

don't need one to find your seats.

There will be no foolish wand-waving
or silly incantations in this class.

As such...

691
00:54:57,712 --> 00:54:59,756
...I don't expect many of you to appreciate...

...the subtle science and exact art
that is potion-making.

However, for those select few...

...who possess the predisposition...

695
00:55:14,771 --> 00:55:18,191
...I can teach you
how to bewitch the mind...

696
00:55:18,274 --> 00:55:21,319
...and ensnare the senses.

697
00:55:21,402 --> 00:55:24,072
I can tell you how to bottle fame...

698
00:55:24,155 --> 00:55:30,078
...brew glory and even
put a stopper in death.

699
00:55:34,374 --> 00:55:39,128
Then again, maybe some of you have
come to Hogwarts with abilities...

700
00:55:39,212 --> 00:55:44,217
{\an8}...so formidable that
you feel confident enough...

714

For your information, Potter,

718
00:57:10,637 --> 00:57:13,389
asphodel and wormwood
make a sleeping potion so powerful

719
00:57:13,473 --> 00:57:16,142
it is known as
the Draught of the Living Dead.

720
00:57:16,225 --> 00:57:19,062
A bezoar is a stone
taken from the stomach of a goat

721
00:57:19,145 --> 00:57:21,648
and it will save you from most poisons.

722
00:57:21,731 --> 00:57:24,359
As for monkshood and wolfsbane,
they are the same plant,

723
00:57:24,442 --> 00:57:27,612
which also goes by the name of aconite.

01:19:06,284 --> 01:19:12,165
{\an8}Good luck today, Potter.
You've proven yourself against a troll.

968
01:19:12,249 --> 01:19:15,460
{\an8}A game of Quidditch
should be easy work.

969
01:19:15,543 --> 01:19:18,046
{\an8}Even if it is against Slytherin.

970
01:19:26,388 --> 01:19:29,808
- That explains the blood.
- Blood?

971
01:19:30,267 --> 01:19:34,437
Last night, I'm guessing Snape let
the troll in as a diversion...

972
01:19:34,521 --> 01:19:37,399
...so he could get past that dog.

973
01:19:37,482 --> 01:19:40,402
But he got bit,
that's why he's limping.

974
01:19:40,485 --> 01:19:42,654
But why would anyone go near that dog?

975
01:19:43,363 --> 01:19:46,700
At Gringotts, Hagrid took
something out of the vault.

976
01:19:46,783 --> 01:19:49,035
Said it was Hogwarts business,
very secret.

977
01:19:50,245 --> 01:19:51,454
HERMIONE:
You're saying--

978
01:19:51,538 --> 01:19:54,791
That's what the dog's guarding.
That's what Snape wants.

979
01:19:54,874 --> 01:19:57,961
[OWL CRIES]

980
01:20:09,139 --> 01:20:13,184
- Bit early for mail, isn't it?
- But I never get mail.

981
01:20:13,768 --> 01:20:15,270
Let's open it.

982
01:20:25,488 --> 01:20:26,698
{\an8}HARRY:
It's a broomstick.

983
01:20:27,532 --> 01:20:31,661
That's not just a broomstick,
it's a Nimbus 2000!

984
01:20:33,121 --> 01:20:34,748
{\an8}But who--?

985
01:20:56,811 --> 01:20:59,397
- Scared, Harry?
- A little.

986
01:20:59,481 --> 01:21:03,276
It's all right. I felt the same way
before my first game.

987
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:06,821
- What happened?
- I don't really remember.

988
01:21:07,197 --> 01:21:09,991
I took a Bludger to the head
two minutes in.

989
01:21:10,075 --> 01:21:11,826
Woke up in hospital a week later.

990
01:21:27,675 --> 01:21:32,347
{\an8}And here it is, the biggest challenge
of this particular film,

991
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:36,017
{\an8}the question that more people were asking me
about as we were making the film:

992
01:21:36,101 --> 01:21:38,353
{\an8}How in God's name are you
going to do Quidditch?

993
01:21:38,436 --> 01:21:41,898
{\an8}Well, we worked on it a long time.

994
01:21:41,981 --> 01:21:47,404
{\an8}And I think part of our concern
was creating the stadium.

995
01:21:47,487 --> 01:21:51,950
{\an8}As written in the books, it was sort of
your typical stadium seating.

996
01:21:52,033 --> 01:21:54,577
{\an8}We wanted to create
an environment with towers.

997
01:21:54,661 --> 01:21:57,789
{\an8}Stuart Craig and I came up
with this idea of towers,

998
01:21:57,872 --> 01:22:02,335
{\an8}so Harry and the other Quidditch players
could fly around something,

999
01:22:02,419 --> 01:22:05,505
{\an8}and we would have something
in the foreground to create a sense of speed.

1000
01:22:05,588 --> 01:22:08,967
{\an8}You don't really have a sense of speed
when you just have the background moving.

1001
01:22:09,050 --> 01:22:11,469
{\an8}We actually needed those towers
in this sequence

1002
01:22:11,553 --> 01:22:13,304
{\an8}to create that sense of speed.

1003
01:22:13,388 --> 01:22:16,141
My dream is to see this sequence in 3D.

1004
01:22:16,224 --> 01:22:19,185
Someday, I would love to get the picture back

1005
01:22:19,269 --> 01:22:23,690
and actually restore it in a 3D version
to see it in an IMAX theater in 3D.

1006
01:22:23,773 --> 01:22:27,986
I think this would benefit in a big way
by seeing it in a 3D environment.

1007
01:22:28,069 --> 01:22:30,655
{\an8}It was important to me to also
teach the audience,

1008
01:22:30,738 --> 01:22:33,908
{\an8}those who were unfamiliar with the books,
the rules of Quidditch,

1009
01:22:33,992 --> 01:22:35,618
{\an8}which I had to learn myself.

1010
01:22:35,702 --> 01:22:39,289
{\an8}Reading the book six or seven times,
I never really understood all of the rules,

1011
01:22:39,372 --> 01:22:41,541
{\an8}so JK Rowling came up
with a chart for me.

1012
01:22:41,624 --> 01:22:44,752
{\an8}She basically gave me the rules of Quidditch,

1013
01:22:44,836 --> 01:22:47,922
{\an8}which I still have, so I was able
to incorporate those into the film.

1014
01:22:49,507 --> 01:22:51,509
{\an8}A lot of this we shot practically.

1015
01:22:51,593 --> 01:22:53,553
{\an8}But a lot of this is obviously CGI work.

1016
01:22:53,636 --> 01:22:56,639
{\an8}The only way to really get these kids
flying on broomsticks

1017
01:22:56,723 --> 01:22:58,516
{\an8}is to put them in a CGI environment.

1018
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:01,895
So we would shoot Harry
and all the individual Quidditch players

1019
01:23:01,978 --> 01:23:03,730
on a separate green-screen stage,

1020
01:23:03,813 --> 01:23:06,191
and, using motion control cameras,

1021
01:23:06,274 --> 01:23:09,736
incorporate them into the backgrounds
of what we see here.

1022
01:23:10,612 --> 01:23:13,239
{\an8}I think that it was one of
the more grueling experiences

1023
01:23:13,323 --> 01:23:15,992
{\an8}for most of the actors
who were working in this sequence,

1024
01:23:16,075 --> 01:23:19,829
{\an8}because riding those brooms
was a tremendously difficult thing,

1025
01:23:19,913 --> 01:23:23,917
{\an8}to create a sense of movement,
to create a sense of urgency,

1026
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,419
{\an8}and also I think, at the same time,

1027
01:23:26,503 --> 01:23:30,632
{\an8}to really feel as if these are
real athletes playing a game.

1028
01:23:30,715 --> 01:23:32,926
{\an8}And that was the biggest challenge for me.

1029
01:23:33,009 --> 01:23:35,094
{\an8}I wanted Quidditch to feel like a real sport.

1030
01:23:35,178 --> 01:23:36,804
I'm a big football and basketball fan,

1031
01:23:36,888 --> 01:23:40,517
and I wanted it to feel
like it was an exciting spectator sport

1032
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:42,727
and one that would really
involve the audience.

1033
01:23:42,810 --> 01:23:46,189
{\an8}So, I think this particular
Quidditch sequence is a lot of fun,

1034
01:23:46,272 --> 01:23:48,733
{\an8}and, again, I hope to see it
in 3D some day.

1035
01:24:03,206 --> 01:24:06,793
- Yes!
- Another 10 points to Gryffindor!

1036
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:22,141
{\an8}Give me that!

1037
01:24:53,923 --> 01:24:55,967
Take that side!

1038
01:25:43,765 --> 01:25:45,516
{\an8}Whoa. Whoa!

1039
01:25:46,059 --> 01:25:48,645
{\an8}HAGRID: What's going on
with Harry's broomstick?

1040
01:25:58,237 --> 01:26:00,573
It's Snape.
He's jinxing the broom!

1041
01:26:00,657 --> 01:26:04,327
- Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
- Leave it to me.

1042
01:26:26,808 --> 01:26:28,267
Come on, Hermione!

1043
01:26:42,448 --> 01:26:45,410
<i>Lacarnum Inflamarae.</i>

1044
01:26:53,292 --> 01:26:56,254
MAN:
Fire! You're on fire!

1045
01:27:14,188 --> 01:27:16,274
{\an8}Go, go, go, go!

1046
01:28:08,367 --> 01:28:10,453
Looks like he's gonna be sick.

1047
01:28:11,788 --> 01:28:13,372
LEE:
He's got the Snitch!

1048
01:28:13,456 --> 01:28:17,668
Harry Potter receives 150 points
for catching the Snitch!

1049
01:28:17,752 --> 01:28:19,420
Gryffindor wins!

1050
01:28:23,007 --> 01:28:25,510
Oh, no.

1051
01:28:28,304 --> 01:28:29,555
Yes!

1052
01:29:03,089 --> 01:29:07,260
{\an8}Nonsense! Why would Snape
put a curse on Harry's broom?

1053
01:29:07,343 --> 01:29:11,514
{\an8}Who knows? Why was he trying
to get past that three-headed dog?

1054
01:29:11,597 --> 01:29:14,100
{\an8}- Who told you about Fluffy?
- Fluffy?

1055
01:29:14,183 --> 01:29:17,979
{\an8}- That thing has a name?
- Of course he has a name. He's mine.

1056
01:29:18,062 --> 01:29:22,733
{\an8}I bought him off an Irishman.
I lent him to Dumbledore to guard--

1057
01:29:22,817 --> 01:29:23,860
Yes?

1058
01:29:23,943 --> 01:29:28,155
Shouldn't have said that.
No more questions! That's top-secret.

1059
01:29:28,781 --> 01:29:32,910
But whatever Fluffy's guarding,
Snape's trying to steal it.

1060
01:29:32,994 --> 01:29:36,998
Codswallop. Professor Snape
is a Hogwarts teacher.

1061
01:29:37,081 --> 01:29:42,086
Teacher or not, I know a spell when
I see one. I've read all about them.

1062
01:29:42,169 --> 01:29:45,965
You've got to keep eye contact,
and Snape wasn't blinking.

1063
01:29:46,048 --> 01:29:48,009
Exactly.

1064
01:29:48,968 --> 01:29:51,762
{\an8}Now, you listen to me,
all three of you.

1065
01:29:51,846 --> 01:29:56,601
{\an8}You're meddling in things that ought
not to be meddled in. It's dangerous.

1066
01:29:56,684 --> 01:30:01,147
{\an8}What that dog is guarding is between
Dumbledore and Nicolas Flamel.

1067
01:30:02,106 --> 01:30:03,482
Nicolas Flamel?

1068
01:30:04,525 --> 01:30:09,280
I shouldn't have said that.
I should not have said that.

1069
01:30:09,363 --> 01:30:13,534
Nicolas Flamel.
Who's Nicolas Flamel?

1070
01:30:13,618 --> 01:30:15,745
I don't know.

1071
01:30:34,597 --> 01:30:37,600
<i>Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas</i>

1072
01:30:37,683 --> 01:30:40,436
<i>Ring the Hogwart bell</i>

1073
01:30:40,645 --> 01:30:43,439
<i>Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas</i>

1074
01:30:43,689 --> 01:30:46,609
<i>Cast a Christmas spell</i>

1075
01:31:00,206 --> 01:31:02,917
Knight to e5.

1076
01:31:11,217 --> 01:31:13,302
Queen to e5.

1077
01:31:18,933 --> 01:31:20,393
That's totally barbaric!

1078
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:24,647
{\an8}That's wizard's chess.
I see you've packed.

1079
01:31:24,730 --> 01:31:26,190
{\an8}I see you haven't.

1080
01:31:26,607 --> 01:31:31,779
{\an8}Change of plans. My parents went
to Romania to visit my brother Charlie.

1081
01:31:31,862 --> 01:31:35,908
{\an8}- He's studying dragons there.
- Good. You can help Harry.

1082
01:31:35,992 --> 01:31:39,537
{\an8}He's going to the library
to look up Nicolas Flamel.

1083
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:42,373
We've looked a hundred times!

1084
01:31:43,749 --> 01:31:48,337
Not in the restricted section.
Happy Christmas.

1085
01:31:51,215 --> 01:31:54,093
I think we've had
a bad influence on her.

1086
01:31:56,679 --> 01:32:00,349
RON: Harry, wake up!
Come on, Harry, wake up!

1087
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:14,196
- Happy Christmas, Harry.
- Happy Christmas, Ron.

1088
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:16,198
What are you wearing?

1089
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:20,828
{\an8}Oh, my mum made it.
Looks like you've got one too.

1090
01:32:21,954 --> 01:32:24,415
{\an8}- I've got presents?
- Yeah.

1091
01:32:31,881 --> 01:32:33,632
RON:
There they are.

1092
01:32:44,977 --> 01:32:48,481
{\an8}"Your father left this
in my possession before he died.

1093
01:32:48,564 --> 01:32:52,777
{\an8}It is time it was returned to you.
Use it well."

1094
01:33:04,413 --> 01:33:07,625
{\an8}So this was another challenging sequence.

1095
01:33:07,708 --> 01:33:11,003
{\an8}Harry gets his invisibility cloak.

1096
01:33:11,087 --> 01:33:14,090
{\an8}It wasn't particularly challenging
to make Harry disappear.

1097
01:33:14,173 --> 01:33:17,301
{\an8}We just had Daniel put on a green cloak.

1098
01:33:17,384 --> 01:33:19,553
{\an8}And then we were able
to erase part of his body.

1099
01:33:19,637 --> 01:33:22,056
{\an8}But the big challenge here

1100
01:33:22,139 --> 01:33:24,850
{\an8}was really how we were going to depict Harry

1101
01:33:24,934 --> 01:33:28,521
{\an8}walking through the library
later in the sequence

1102
01:33:28,604 --> 01:33:30,523
{\an8}and see the cloak around him.

1103
01:33:30,606 --> 01:33:33,984
{\an8}How does an audience member accept that

1104
01:33:34,068 --> 01:33:37,613
{\an8}when we're introducing
the concept of invisibility?

1105
01:33:37,696 --> 01:33:40,908
{\an8}So what we did, we actually shot,
which you will see later,

1106
01:33:40,991 --> 01:33:47,998
{\an8}Daniel Radcliffe underneath
sort of a gauze, lace version of the cloak.

1107
01:33:48,082 --> 01:33:51,836
{\an8}And it seems completely inconsistent stylistically

1108
01:33:51,919 --> 01:33:54,046
{\an8}with the concept of invisibility.

1109
01:33:54,130 --> 01:33:58,134
{\an8}But when you see him walking
with this cloak over him,

1110
01:33:58,217 --> 01:34:00,219
{\an8}you immediately buy that concept.

1111
01:34:00,302 --> 01:34:06,142
{\an8}And this was a very, very tense day
of shooting for me,

1112
01:34:06,225 --> 01:34:09,645
{\an8}because we were allowed into this library,
the Bodleian Library.

1113
01:34:09,770 --> 01:34:14,358
{\an8}And all of these books you see are
hundreds and hundreds of years old, one of a kind.

1114
01:34:14,441 --> 01:34:16,402
{\an8}So we really had to be very careful.

1115
01:34:16,485 --> 01:34:21,907
{\an8}It was the first film in a long time that
was permitted to shoot in this particular library.

1116
01:34:21,991 --> 01:34:27,454
{\an8}When Harry-- One of the biggest moments
for the audience ironically in this film,

1117
01:34:27,538 --> 01:34:29,582
{\an8}which is a small moment, really, in the books,

1118
01:34:29,665 --> 01:34:33,586
{\an8}is when he opens this first book
and this face pops out of the book.

1119
01:34:33,669 --> 01:34:36,964
{\an8}We did that with digital effects,
but it works really well.

1120
01:34:37,047 --> 01:34:39,133
{\an8}But the audience jumped out of their seats.

1121
01:34:39,216 --> 01:34:43,554
{\an8}The kids particularly weren't expecting
that kind of scare at that particular time.

He seemed like he stepped out
of an old David Lean picture, you know?

in <i>Great Expectations</i> or <i>Oliver Twist,</i>

{\an8}All right, here we are in the Forbidden Forest.

1320
01:53:47,947 --> 01:53:51,701
{\an8}Now, this is an interesting sequence
because we actually shot

1321
01:53:51,784 --> 01:53:55,663
{\an8}the beginning of the sequence
in a real forest outside of London,

1322
01:53:55,747 --> 01:54:01,711
{\an8}and shot at night, filled it with fog,
and really wanted to create this sense of mystery.

1323
01:54:01,794 --> 01:54:04,464
{\an8}And as we get further into the forest,

1324
01:54:04,547 --> 01:54:08,134
{\an8}we move onto a set
that we built on the Leavesden soundstage.

1325
01:54:08,217 --> 01:54:10,303
{\an8}It was a fairly big set.

1326
01:54:10,386 --> 01:54:12,055
{\an8}It was very impressive, actually.

1327
01:54:12,138 --> 01:54:14,515
{\an8}We brought in all these real trees,
all these roots.

1328
01:54:14,599 --> 01:54:16,267
{\an8}And Stuart Craig, again, outdid himself

1329
01:54:16,351 --> 01:54:18,936
{\an8}because this feels like
a very, very real location.

1330
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:23,316
{\an8}This is the first time
that Harry encounters Voldemort.

1331
01:54:23,399 --> 01:54:27,820
{\an8}Well, who we know is Quirrell
later in the picture.

1332
01:54:27,904 --> 01:54:30,907
{\an8}But drinking unicorn blood,
and this proved to be a challenge

1333
01:54:30,990 --> 01:54:34,077
because unicorn blood
is supposed to be silver.

1334
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:37,663
Obviously we couldn't put mercury
in anyone's mouth.

1335
01:54:37,747 --> 01:54:41,376
And that's the only liquid
that has that metallic look.

1336
01:54:41,459 --> 01:54:46,881
{\an8}So what we did is we put
green liquid in our actor's mouth

1337
01:54:46,964 --> 01:54:49,133
{\an8}and then we changed it
to that silvery sort of look.

1338
01:54:49,217 --> 01:54:53,096
{\an8}Again, as you can probably tell,
this was done practically

1339
01:54:53,179 --> 01:54:57,016
with an actor on wires
who stood up and walked close to Harry.

1340
01:54:57,100 --> 01:54:58,540
At this point, we didn't really have

1341
01:54:58,601 --> 01:55:01,437
a definitive idea of what Voldemort
was gonna look like.

1342
01:55:01,562 --> 01:55:05,483
And I thought it was more frightening for
the audience if they didn't see his face at this point.

1343
01:55:05,566 --> 01:55:07,568
{\an8}This was a very scary scene.

1344
01:55:07,652 --> 01:55:11,614
{\an8}This first part was really done
without the benefit of visual effects,

1345
01:55:11,697 --> 01:55:13,991
{\an8}and then, of course,
the centaur comes into the scene.

It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn.

your lips, you will have a half-life.

I think the centaur works beautifully here,

02:03:09,174 --> 02:03:13,554
This was a scene where we had to create
a CGI three-headed animal,

1441
02:03:13,637 --> 02:03:15,723
and I thought they did a wonderful job.

1442
02:03:15,806 --> 02:03:19,560
When they moved the paw, we created
a giant, furry paw for the kids to move.

1443
02:03:19,643 --> 02:03:23,355
But when they lifted it, practically,
the paw just looked like a giant stuffed animal.

1444
02:03:23,439 --> 02:03:26,650
So we had to literally draw over it
using our computer animation,

1445
02:03:26,734 --> 02:03:29,653
so when the kids lifted the paw
off of the trap door,

1446
02:03:29,737 --> 02:03:31,947
there was actually some movement
in the fingers,

1447
02:03:32,031 --> 02:03:35,034
and it felt like it was real
and it was alive.

1448
02:03:40,831 --> 02:03:44,460
I'll go first. Don't follow
until I give you a sign.

1449

If something bad happens,
get yourselves out.

1450
02:03:50,466 --> 02:03:53,969
Does it seem a bit quiet to you?

1451
02:03:54,637 --> 02:03:56,013
The harp.

1452
02:03:57,139 --> 02:03:58,974
It's stopped playing.

1453
02:04:01,268 --> 02:04:04,313
Ugh. Yuck!

02:04:09,860 --> 02:04:11,028

1456
02:04:23,374 --> 02:04:24,458
Whoa.

1457
02:04:25,209 --> 02:04:27,920
{\an8}Lucky this plant thing's here, really.

1458
02:04:28,712 --> 02:04:30,506
{\an8}Whoa!

1459
02:04:43,227 --> 02:04:46,480
{\an8}HERMIONE: Stop moving, both of you.
This is Devil's Snare.

1460
02:04:46,605 --> 02:04:50,401
{\an8}You have to relax. If you don't,
it will only kill you faster.

1461
02:04:50,484 --> 02:04:54,822
{\an8}Kill us faster?
Oh, now I can relax!

1462
02:04:55,990 --> 02:04:57,616
COLUMBUS:
So for Devil's Snare,

1463
02:04:57,700 --> 02:04:59,910
{\an8}I said, "Okay, let's us build Devil's Snare,

1464
02:04:59,994 --> 02:05:04,331
{\an8}and I'll shoot it in a way that we don't
have to incorporate any digital effects.

1465
02:05:04,415 --> 02:05:06,333
I'll shoot it in reverse."

1466
02:05:06,417 --> 02:05:11,505
So all of these sequences are actually done
with real, practical puppeteers,

1467
02:05:11,588 --> 02:05:13,465
below the Devil's Snare set,

1468
02:05:13,549 --> 02:05:17,136
actually moving the tentacles
in each sequence.

1469
02:05:17,219 --> 02:05:19,346
And when the kids are wrapped
with the tentacles,

1470
02:05:19,430 --> 02:05:22,099
the kids were actually able
to act in reverse.

1471
02:05:22,182 --> 02:05:25,686
It's better than any CGI version of it
we could have ever done.

1472
02:05:25,769 --> 02:05:28,397
Because the kids, who needed it at the time,

1473
02:05:28,480 --> 02:05:30,858
as opposed to dealing with
just a green screen situation,

1474
02:05:30,941 --> 02:05:34,695
were actually able to act
with real, tangible effects

1475
02:05:34,778 --> 02:05:37,114
and it worked beautifully.

<i>Lumus Solem.</i>

1477
02:05:45,664 --> 02:05:47,875
{\an8}And Hermione saves the day,
which is a huge moment.

1478
02:05:47,958 --> 02:05:52,755
{\an8}Only visual effects shot is the shot of the wand
coming up through the Devil's Snare sequence,

1479
02:05:52,838 --> 02:05:54,673
{\an8}through the Devil's Snare area.

1480
02:05:54,757 --> 02:05:57,176
{\an8}And I love the fact that Hermione
has her moment there.

1481
02:05:57,259 --> 02:05:59,887
{\an8}It's just a great, wonderful moment for her.

What is that?

1484
02:06:02,723 --> 02:06:06,435
I don't know. Sounds like wings.

1485
02:06:19,615 --> 02:06:23,202
HERMIONE: Curious.
I've never seen birds like these.

1486
02:06:23,285 --> 02:06:26,914
HARRY: They're not birds.
They're keys.

1487

And I'll bet one of them
fits that door.

- I don't know.

Well, it was worth a try.

1492

What will we do?
There must be a thousand keys.

Probably rusty.

It's too simple.

on that old broomstick, you can.

You're the youngest Seeker

I don't like this at all.

Where are we? A graveyard.

1504
02:08:53,060 --> 02:08:55,103
This is no graveyard.

1505
02:09:03,153 --> 02:09:04,863
It's a chessboard.

1506
02:09:04,947 --> 02:09:08,867
{\an8}Here we have Wizard's Chess, one of
the 50 sequences I was most excited about doing.

1507
02:09:08,951 --> 02:09:10,911
{\an8}The great thing about these Harry Potter books

1508
02:09:10,994 --> 02:09:15,165
{\an8}is that every sequence, as a director,
you're like a kid in a candy store.

1509
02:09:15,249 --> 02:09:17,709
{\an8}But for me, this was an exciting sequence,

1510
02:09:17,793 --> 02:09:19,503
{\an8}because we could have, again,

1511
02:09:19,586 --> 02:09:22,965
{\an8}built all of this in a digital environment,
put the kids in a green-screen world,

1512
02:09:23,048 --> 02:09:24,049
{\an8}but we didn't.

1513
02:09:24,132 --> 02:09:26,760
{\an8}Stuart Craig built this entire set

1514
02:09:26,843 --> 02:09:29,972
{\an8}and created each one of those chess pieces.

1515
02:09:30,055 --> 02:09:32,307
{\an8}So, when you walked onto that set,

1516
02:09:32,391 --> 02:09:35,686
{\an8}you saw all of these life-size chess pieces

1517
02:09:35,769 --> 02:09:38,188
{\an8}and this chessboard surrounded by fire,

1518
02:09:38,272 --> 02:09:40,357
{\an8}and it was amazing.

1519
02:09:40,440 --> 02:09:43,360
{\an8}I mean, I was in awe
of what Stuart had done here.

1520
02:09:43,443 --> 02:09:46,405
{\an8}I wanted to take several of the pieces
back to America with me

1521
02:09:46,488 --> 02:09:48,699
{\an8}and put them up around my house,
I was so impressed.

1522
02:09:48,782 --> 02:09:50,617
{\an8}They looked like these wonderful sculptures.

1523
02:09:50,701 --> 02:09:53,328
{\an8}And we utilized CGI in certain elements.

1524
02:09:53,412 --> 02:09:57,124
{\an8}When you see the pawns draw their swords,
those sort of things,

1525
02:09:57,207 --> 02:10:01,211
{\an8}we utilized CGI to create a sense
of movement among the chess pieces.

1526
02:10:01,295 --> 02:10:03,797
{\an8}But all of these other chess pieces are real.

1527
02:10:03,880 --> 02:10:05,549
{\an8}And they even moved forward.

1528
02:10:05,632 --> 02:10:09,845
{\an8}When Ron's chess piece moves forward here,
when he's making his tremendous sacrifice,

1529
02:10:09,928 --> 02:10:11,138
these were practical.

1530
02:10:11,221 --> 02:10:13,473
And the combined movement of the camera,

1531
02:10:13,557 --> 02:10:17,019
along with the pieces mechanically moving
along the floor,

1532
02:10:17,102 --> 02:10:20,981
created a real sense of terror
and a real suspenseful moment.

1533
02:10:21,064 --> 02:10:23,400
{\an8}There was talk about
making them move more quickly,

1534
02:10:23,483 --> 02:10:27,029
{\an8}and I just loved the fact
that this sequence happened

1535
02:10:27,112 --> 02:10:28,405
{\an8}at its own pace.

1536
02:10:28,488 --> 02:10:30,824
{\an8}One of my favorite shots in the movie

1537
02:10:30,907 --> 02:10:34,578
{\an8}is Ron really deciding to sacrifice himself.

1538
02:10:34,661 --> 02:10:38,707
{\an8}And that to me is just
an amazing performance by a kid

1539
02:10:38,790 --> 02:10:41,293
{\an8}who was starting to feel
very comfortable with his character.

1540
02:10:41,376 --> 02:10:43,712
{\an8}He sees the power of these things,

1541
02:10:43,795 --> 02:10:47,007
{\an8}and he realizes he's gotta sacrifice himself
for his friends.

1542
02:10:47,090 --> 02:10:52,387
{\an8}I sensed a real moment of fear
but also courage from Rupert at that point.

1543
02:10:52,471 --> 02:10:55,223
{\an8}Probably his best performance in the film.

02:10:59,186 --> 02:11:01,646

- Wait a minute.
RON: You understand right, Harry.

02:11:56,451 --> 02:12:00,831
Once I make my move,
the queen will take me.

Then you're free to check the king.

- No. Ron, no!
- What is it?

1550

- He's going to sacrifice himself.
- No, there must be another way!

While everyone ran about, he went
to the third floor to head me off.

02:18:08,072 --> 02:18:11,367
{\an8}so ironically, in a weird way,

1601
02:18:11,451 --> 02:18:15,830
this Voldemort kind of resembles
the Ralph Fiennes you see in the later pictures.

1602
02:18:15,914 --> 02:18:18,416
I always thought I would want to go back--

1603
02:18:18,500 --> 02:18:20,585
again, as a director,
you always want to go back--

1604
02:18:20,668 --> 02:18:24,756
want to go back and reshoot this,
or reshoot that particular part of it,

1605
02:18:24,839 --> 02:18:27,342
{\an8}so the films would have a real consistency.

1606
02:18:27,425 --> 02:18:32,180
{\an8}It would be great to reshoot it
with Ralph Fiennes' voice and look now.

1607
02:18:32,263 --> 02:18:33,681
{\an8}This is pretty close.

1608
02:18:33,765 --> 02:18:38,061
{\an8}But it's not exactly where we are
in the later pictures.

1609
02:18:38,144 --> 02:18:41,731
But for a visual effect at the time,
I was very impressed

1610
02:18:41,815 --> 02:18:44,317
at what our visual effects department
came up with here.

1611
02:18:44,400 --> 02:18:46,653
Because it was a concept
that was quite odd.

1612
02:18:47,487 --> 02:18:50,365
{\an8}Only Jo Rowling could have come up with the fact

1613
02:18:50,448 --> 02:18:53,660
{\an8}that Voldemort appears
out of the back of a man's head.

1614
02:18:53,743 --> 02:18:58,540
{\an8}It's kind of a grotesque and fascinating idea.
How do you do it?

1615
02:18:58,623 --> 02:19:04,295
{\an8}Well, we had our actor wearing
little green dots on the back of his head,

1616
02:19:04,379 --> 02:19:07,590
{\an8}and then Voldemort was added much later.

1617
02:19:07,674 --> 02:19:12,262
{\an8}I was just intrigued by this sequence,
because I thought it would be so horrifying.

1618
02:19:12,345 --> 02:19:15,515
And we wanted to make it fairly horrifying
for the little kiddies out there.

1619
02:19:15,598 --> 02:19:19,269
I thought it would be so horrifying
that the film would get a PG-13,

1620
02:19:19,352 --> 02:19:21,563
which is not what we wanted
on the first Potter film.

1621
02:19:21,896 --> 02:19:24,858
But for some reason,
kids weren't running out of the theater.

1622
02:19:24,941 --> 02:19:27,402
They were emotionally invested
in the film at this point.

1623
02:19:27,485 --> 02:19:29,654
Because I think there was
an emotional quality here.

1624
02:19:29,737 --> 02:19:31,531
{\an8}When you combine Harry's parents

1625
02:19:31,614 --> 02:19:35,326
{\an8}along with this hideous Voldemort face,

1626
02:19:35,410 --> 02:19:40,665
{\an8}I think that you sort of temper it a little bit,
you soften it a little for the kids in the audience.

1627
02:19:41,666 --> 02:19:43,751
{\an8}The casting of Harry's parents was difficult

1628
02:19:43,835 --> 02:19:46,546
because we knew they would be
in subsequent pictures,

1629
02:19:46,629 --> 02:19:48,631
but at this point, we hadn't read all the books,

1630
02:19:48,715 --> 02:19:51,551
{\an8}so we didn't know if they would appear
in book five, six, seven.

1631
02:19:51,634 --> 02:19:53,011
{\an8}We had no idea.

1632
02:19:53,094 --> 02:19:55,930
{\an8}And Jo really didn't give us
that particular information.

1633
02:19:56,014 --> 02:20:00,184
{\an8}So we cast people who have since
appeared in subsequent pictures,

1634
02:20:00,268 --> 02:20:03,813
{\an8}and we didn't know if they would get to speak
or how much we would get to know them.

1635
02:20:03,897 --> 02:20:07,942
{\an8}This was done with-- again, we built this set.

1636
02:20:08,902 --> 02:20:11,613
{\an8}That's all real fire in the background,

1637
02:20:11,696 --> 02:20:17,327
{\an8}again, in an effort to give the kids a sense
of tangible things they could hold onto.

1638
02:20:36,054 --> 02:20:40,808
{\an8}- What is this magic?
- Fool, get the Stone!

1639
02:20:42,685 --> 02:20:44,854
{\an8}Our actor here who played Quirrell,

1640
02:20:44,938 --> 02:20:47,357
{\an8}was there for Dan all the time.

1641
02:20:47,440 --> 02:20:52,320
Obviously, when his face is burning
and disintegrating, these are all CGI effects.

1642
02:20:53,404 --> 02:20:56,532
To do this practically
would probably hurt someone.

1643
02:20:56,616 --> 02:20:58,201
We didn't do that.

1644
02:20:58,284 --> 02:21:01,829
This was a little homage
to one of my favorite pictures from the late '50s,

1645
02:21:01,913 --> 02:21:06,709
<i>Horror of Dracula,</i> one of the Hammer films,
where Christopher Lee disintegrates at the end.

1646
02:21:07,210 --> 02:21:10,338
{\an8}I think I even borrowed a shot
from that final sequence,

1647
02:21:10,421 --> 02:21:12,799
{\an8}where Christopher Lee is defeated
by Peter Cushing.

1648
02:21:12,882 --> 02:21:18,346
{\an8}And our stone, the big moment in our movie,

1649
02:21:18,429 --> 02:21:21,849
the Sorcerer's Stone, the Philosopher's Stone,
was really created out of plastic.

1650
02:21:21,933 --> 02:21:25,561
We had several of these
that were made by our prop department.

1651
02:21:25,645 --> 02:21:28,731
Sometimes they looked like candy.
They weren't shiny enough.

1652
02:21:28,815 --> 02:21:31,442
And the only way we could ever get
the sense of a reflection

1653
02:21:31,526 --> 02:21:33,778
was to put a reflection
of a flame in there.

1654
02:21:33,861 --> 02:21:37,240
Voldemort here is obviously created
through a CGI effect,

1655
02:21:37,323 --> 02:21:39,951
which was very effective.

1656
02:21:40,034 --> 02:21:44,539
Again, in Jo's world, which is so wonderful
and imaginative and amazing,

1657
02:21:44,622 --> 02:21:46,708
Voldemort actually has to pass through Harry,

1658
02:21:46,791 --> 02:21:49,711
which I just thought was something
I'd never seen before.

1659
02:22:26,664 --> 02:22:28,583
Good afternoon, Harry.

1660
02:22:31,294 --> 02:22:35,882
- Tokens from your admirers?
- Admirers?

1661
02:22:35,965 --> 02:22:42,096
What happened in the dungeons between
you and Professor Quirrell is a secret.

1662
02:22:42,180 --> 02:22:46,517
So, naturally, the whole school knows.

1663
02:22:49,312 --> 02:22:53,107
I see that your friend Ronald
has saved you the trouble...

1664
02:22:53,191 --> 02:22:56,152
...of opening your Chocolate Frogs.

1665
02:22:56,235 --> 02:22:59,155
Ron was here? Is he all right?
What about Hermione?

1666
02:22:59,614 --> 02:23:03,659
Fine. They're both just fine.

1667
02:23:04,911 --> 02:23:07,830
- What happened to the Stone?
- Relax, dear boy.

1668
02:23:07,914 --> 02:23:10,208
The Stone has been destroyed.

1669
02:23:11,542 --> 02:23:14,170
My friend Nicolas and I
have had a little chat...

1670
02:23:14,253 --> 02:23:18,883
...and agreed it was best all around.

1671
02:23:19,926 --> 02:23:22,970
But then, Flamel,
he'll die, won't he?

1672
02:23:25,598 --> 02:23:30,144
He has enough Elixir
to set his affairs in order.

1673
02:23:31,312 --> 02:23:34,649
But yes, he will die.

1674
02:23:34,732 --> 02:23:37,276
How is it I got the Stone, sir?

1675
02:23:37,360 --> 02:23:40,071
One minute I was staring
in the mirror and--

1676
02:23:40,154 --> 02:23:43,616
You see, only a person...

1677
02:23:44,617 --> 02:23:48,454
...who wanted to find the Stone,
find it...

1678
02:23:48,538 --> 02:23:52,625
...but not use it,
would be able to get it.

1679
02:23:54,210 --> 02:23:57,797
That is one of my more brilliant ideas.

1680
02:23:57,880 --> 02:24:02,301
And between you and me,
that is saying something.

1681
02:24:04,387 --> 02:24:09,767
Does that mean, with the Stone gone,
that Voldemort can never come back?

1682
02:24:09,851 --> 02:24:11,894
I'm afraid...

1683
02:24:13,563 --> 02:24:16,649
...there are ways
in which he can return.

1684
02:24:18,359 --> 02:24:21,028
Harry, do you know why...

1685
02:24:21,112 --> 02:24:24,657
...Professor Quirrell couldn't bear
to have you touch him?

1686
02:24:25,366 --> 02:24:30,079
It was because of your mother.
She sacrificed herself for you.

1687
02:24:30,663 --> 02:24:33,082
And that kind of act leaves a mark.

1688
02:24:33,916 --> 02:24:37,837
No, this kind of mark cannot be seen.

1689
02:24:37,920 --> 02:24:42,967
- It lives in your very skin.
- What is it?

1690
02:24:43,718 --> 02:24:47,430
{\an8}Love, Harry. Love.

1691
02:24:55,521 --> 02:24:59,609
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

1692
02:24:59,692 --> 02:25:04,530
I was most unfortunate in my youth
to come across a vomit-flavored one.

1693
02:25:04,614 --> 02:25:08,201
{\an8}And since then,
I've lost my liking for them.

1694
02:25:08,284 --> 02:25:11,787
{\an8}But I think I could be safe...

1695
02:25:11,871 --> 02:25:13,915
{\an8}...with a nice toffee.

1696
02:25:16,959 --> 02:25:19,879
{\an8}Hm, alas!

1697
02:25:20,588 --> 02:25:22,215
{\an8}Earwax.

1698
02:25:37,939 --> 02:25:41,192
- All right there, Ron?
- All right. You?

1699
02:25:42,235 --> 02:25:45,029
All right. Hermione?

1700
02:25:45,613 --> 02:25:47,448
Never better.

1701
02:26:03,256 --> 02:26:05,800
Another year gone.

1702
02:26:06,550 --> 02:26:11,138
And now, as I understand it,
the house cup needs awarding.

1703
02:26:11,222 --> 02:26:13,975
And the points stand thus:

1704
02:26:14,058 --> 02:26:18,604
In fourth place,
Gryffindor with 312 points.

1705
02:26:21,857 --> 02:26:27,530
Third place,
Hufflepuff with 352 points.

1706
02:26:32,702 --> 02:26:34,829
In second place...

1707
02:26:34,912 --> 02:26:39,625
...Ravenclaw with 426 points.

1708
02:26:45,214 --> 02:26:47,049
And in first place...

1709
02:26:47,133 --> 02:26:52,263
...with 472 points, Slytherin house.

1710
02:26:58,311 --> 02:27:00,604
Nice one, mate.

1711
02:27:04,400 --> 02:27:07,528
{\an8}Yes, well done, Slytherin.
Well done.

1712
02:27:07,611 --> 02:27:13,117
{\an8}However, recent events must
be taken into account.

1713
02:27:13,200 --> 02:27:17,455
{\an8}And I have a few last-minute points
to award.

1714
02:27:18,831 --> 02:27:24,086
To Miss Hermione Granger,
for the cool use of intellect...

1715
02:27:24,503 --> 02:27:27,381
...while others were in grave peril...

1716
02:27:28,090 --> 02:27:29,884
...50 points.

1717
02:27:31,218 --> 02:27:32,553
Good job.

1718
02:27:40,186 --> 02:27:46,317
Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley,
for the best-played game of chess...

1719
02:27:46,817 --> 02:27:52,073
...that Hogwarts has seen
these many years, 50 points.

1720
02:27:56,577 --> 02:27:58,162
{\an8}And third...

1721
02:27:59,288 --> 02:28:02,208
{\an8}...to Mr. Harry Potter...

1722
02:28:02,291 --> 02:28:06,670
{\an8}...for pure nerve
and outstanding courage...

1723
02:28:07,213 --> 02:28:12,134
{\an8}...I award Gryffindor house 60 points.

1724
02:28:20,393 --> 02:28:21,769
{\an8}We're tied with Slytherin!

1725
02:28:22,561 --> 02:28:28,567
{\an8}Finally, it takes a great deal of bravery
to stand up to your enemies...

1726
02:28:28,651 --> 02:28:32,113
{\an8}...but a great deal more
to stand up to your friends.

1727
02:28:32,780 --> 02:28:35,866
{\an8}I award 10 points...

1728
02:28:35,950 --> 02:28:38,536
{\an8}...to Neville Longbottom.

1729
02:28:52,466 --> 02:28:55,052
{\an8}Assuming that my calculations
are correct...

1730
02:28:55,136 --> 02:28:59,932
{\an8}...I believe that a change
of decoration is in order.

1731
02:29:05,646 --> 02:29:09,108
Gryffindor wins the house cup.

1732
02:29:11,193 --> 02:29:12,653
Yes!

1733
02:29:28,794 --> 02:29:30,045
We won!

1734
02:29:44,226 --> 02:29:46,729
[TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS]

1735
02:29:47,313 --> 02:29:50,024
HAGRID: Come on, now.
Hurry up, you'll be late.

1736
02:29:50,691 --> 02:29:54,278
Train's leaving. Go on.
Come on, hurry up.

1737
02:30:00,409 --> 02:30:03,204
- Come on, Harry.
- One minute.

1738
02:30:10,002 --> 02:30:13,130
Thought you were leaving
without saying goodbye, did you?

1739
02:30:16,926 --> 02:30:18,761
This is for you.

1740
02:30:35,528 --> 02:30:36,612
Thanks, Hagrid.

1741
02:30:43,452 --> 02:30:48,040
{\an8}Go on. On with you. On with you now.
Oh, listen, Harry.

1742
02:30:48,123 --> 02:30:52,878
{\an8}If that dolt of a cousin of yours,
Dudley, gives you any grief...

1743
02:30:52,962 --> 02:30:55,798
{\an8}...you could always threaten him...

1744
02:30:55,881 --> 02:30:58,884
...with a nice pair of ears
to go with his tail.

1745
02:30:58,968 --> 02:31:04,223
But we're not allowed to do magic
away from Hogwarts. You know that.

1746
02:31:04,306 --> 02:31:08,936
I do. But your cousin don't, do he?

1747
02:31:10,980 --> 02:31:14,358
COLUMBUS: Dan's first spoken line
in a Harry Potter movie

1748
02:31:14,441 --> 02:31:17,695
{\an8}comes when he says,
"I'm not going home. Not really."

1749
02:31:17,778 --> 02:31:19,863
I'm not going home.

1750
02:31:19,947 --> 02:31:20,990
Not really.

1751
02:31:21,073 --> 02:31:22,866
{\an8}And when he says that,

1752
02:31:22,950 --> 02:31:25,119
{\an8}when I saw the dailies to that,

1753
02:31:25,202 --> 02:31:27,663
{\an8}I was actually very touched.
I had tears in my eyes.

1754
02:31:27,746 --> 02:31:30,124
{\an8}I looked over at David Heyman.
He's got tears in his eyes.

1755
02:31:30,249 --> 02:31:35,671
{\an8}And I said, "How is it this kid came up
with such a very unsentimental, real performance?"

1756
02:31:35,754 --> 02:31:39,133
{\an8}And that is just a testament
to Dan's ability as an actor,

1757
02:31:39,216 --> 02:31:41,176
{\an8}even from the very first day on this film.

1758
02:32:04,950 --> 02:32:07,286
I hope you guys had
a wonderful time watching this.

1759
02:32:07,369 --> 02:32:09,121
I could talk about this forever,

1760
02:32:09,455 --> 02:32:10,372
{\an8}so, thank you so much.

1761
02:32:10,456 --> 02:32:15,836
{\an8}This has been a real pleasure for me
to revisit the world of Harry Potter,

1762
02:32:15,919 --> 02:32:17,463
{\an8}which means so much to me. Thanks.

1763
02:40:12,813 --> 02:40:15,816
NARRATOR:
<i>Well, there were a few close calls,</i>

1764
02:40:15,899 --> 02:40:21,571
<i>mean monsters,
poisonous professors and wicked wizards.</i>

1765
02:40:21,655 --> 02:40:25,242
<i>But Harry, Ron and Hermione
survived their first year at Hogwarts.</i>

1766
02:40:26,243 --> 02:40:28,370
<i>Now how did you fare?</i>

1767
02:40:29,287 --> 02:40:30,664
<i>Time to add up your points.</i>

1768
02:40:30,747 --> 02:40:34,376
<i>To begin, let's see where
the Golden Snitch was buzzing about.</i>

1769
02:40:34,918 --> 02:40:36,586
<i>Didn't waste any time, I see.</i>

1770
02:40:37,045 --> 02:40:39,464
<i>A cozy common room,
can't say I blame you.</i>

1771
02:40:40,257 --> 02:40:42,467
<i>A-ha! Easy-peasy.</i>

1772
02:40:43,009 --> 02:40:45,387
<i>It would take a Seeker
to get you up there.</i>

1773
02:40:46,388 --> 02:40:48,348
<i>Sneaky little Snitch, aren't you?</i>

1774
02:40:49,224 --> 02:40:51,309
<i>Hello, hello, hello.</i>

1775
02:40:51,393 --> 02:40:56,398
<i>Right then, award yourself 25 points
for every Snitch you spotted.</i>

1776
02:40:56,481 --> 02:40:58,650
{\an8}<i>And onto the Hogwarts Trivia Challenge.</i>

1777
02:40:59,234 --> 02:41:02,404
<i>Score five points for every question
you answered correctly.</i>

1778
02:41:02,988 --> 02:41:05,157
<i>Go on, add them up.</i>

1779
02:41:05,240 --> 02:41:08,535
<i>Now, if you scored
between five and 100 points,</i>

1780
02:41:08,618 --> 02:41:11,204
<i>tut-tut, better luck next time.</i>

1781
02:41:11,705 --> 02:41:15,292
<i>Here, perhaps a Remembrall
will come in handy.</i>

1782
02:41:15,375 --> 02:41:17,169
<i>Or a dozen.</i>

1783
02:41:18,461 --> 02:41:22,174
<i>If you scored between 105 and 200 points,
well done!</i>

1784
02:41:22,799 --> 02:41:26,887
<i>Smarter than a Mountain Troll,
but a bit short of Hermione Granger.</i>

1785
02:41:26,970 --> 02:41:30,182
<i>Nevertheless, a chocolate frog for you.</i>

1786
02:41:32,100 --> 02:41:35,103
<i>If you scored between 205 and 300 points...</i>

1787
02:41:35,729 --> 02:41:38,231
<i>Brilliant! You know your Harry Potter.</i>

1788
02:41:38,315 --> 02:41:43,820
<i>That deserves your very own Nimbus 2000.</i>

1789
02:41:44,613 --> 02:41:50,285
<i>And if you scored a perfect score,
all 300 points...</i>

1790
02:41:50,744 --> 02:41:53,371
<i>hmm, could it be?</i>

1791
02:41:54,456 --> 02:41:56,625
<i>Could it be?</i>

1792
02:41:57,918 --> 02:42:00,670
<i>Bravo! You win the house cup!</i>

1793
02:42:02,839 --> 02:42:06,051
<i>Alas, that's all the magic
we have for now...</i>

1794
02:42:06,509 --> 02:42:09,095
<i>until our next year at Hogwarts.</i>
